Fluifia has high affinity with water essence, making them water adept by default. Their skin actively produce and keep a slight moisture, making them somewhat reflective and shiny. The tip of their hair is transparent and when it's cut, it will gradually restore the transparent look within a week. This variant is often regarded as the most beautiful kind.

They have difficulty with manipulating other essences, so most of them will only know water arts. They are the first to invent wound mending water arts that can be applied to other without causing overload, although only Fluifia can do them correctly.
