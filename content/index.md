## About Encyclomedia
The Encyclomedia is an archival / documentation project by us, [[Flowchart]], in hope to record all things about essence. Our records will revolve around [[Grondvale]] but we strive to branch out to other places as much as we can.
## Getting Started
- [[Biology/index|Biology]] - Common Flora and Fauna throughout Essencia.
- [[Essence/index|Essence]] - Element type, usage, side-effect, history, etc. are here.
- [[/World/index|World]] - Grondvale and her surrounding, near and far.

> [!warning]+ Notice
> Hello, Ouklen here. As you can see, the pages are still all over the place and in need of proofreading, fact-checking, and all that stuff. Do note that some of the classified information might be mixed with the draft here, so please don't share this with outsiders!
