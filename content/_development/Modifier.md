## Image
``` Image Link
![[image/path|modifier|size]]
```
Custom Modifier List:
- `block` : Apply image on site as `display:block;` 

## Folder Index
``` Hide-folder-content
<div class="hide-folder-content">Modded</div>
```
Add this anywhere within a page, the text is to make it obvious during edit and is hidden on production. This will hide folder content. Useful if we want custom listing.
