You might notice that the term element and essence are used together, seemingly interchangeable, but is there any difference? If so, what is it?

Element refers to their own type while Essence is their non-physical form, natural or not. A "<font color="#c0504d">Fire Essence</font>" is "<font color="#4f81bd">Fire Element</font>", but "<font color="#4f81bd">Fire Element</font>" doesn't necessarily mean "<font color="#c0504d">Fire Essence</font>".

When describing fire essence, it might be refered as (fire) element. This mean the topic will be applicable to fire in general.
