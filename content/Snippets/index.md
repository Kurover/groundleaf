A collection of notes that is dedicated for clarification, in hope to avoid breaking the flow of the content. It also help to avoid duplicate description in case the term is used multiple times.

These notes are readable as is, but it may lack the full context. If that's the case, you can easily look up the source of the mention on the dedicated "Backlink" section.

> [!attention]
> The main use for this section right now is to release a summarized points for an unfinished part from other category. Expect notes in here to be removed later.
