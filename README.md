# Groundleaf Project | Encyclomedia
An "in-world" book containing lore about the world of Essencia, Grondvale in particular. This wiki is made possible using [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Hosted on our beloved Octocat domain, GitHub, of course.

Content is unfinished. Currently this is just a test site to see how the workflow will be. I plan to upload whatever is readable since I don't really expect traffic other than me and my friends. If you somehow follow it, prepare to be confused since changes will and going to be made.

Previously I wanted to do this using TiddlyWiki, but after tinkering it for long, it's kinda cumbersome to use if it's not used as simple note-taking software. After looking through more option (and as I gain more experience in building random things from source), I stumbled across quartz and decided that I'm using it!

## To-dos
- Light/dark mode with main site palette
- Style the graph view? or don't use it, not sure.
- Try to move the light/dark mode switch on desktop to somewhere less... whitespace-y.
- Update object locale to more immersive naming convention.
